          <h2>Why New Zealand?</h2>
          <h3>New Zealand, The Land of the Long WHite Cloud‚òÅÔ∏è</h3>
          <p>
            New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
            It consists of two main landmasses‚Äîthe North Island and the South
            Island ‚Äî and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest
            island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman
            Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The
            country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the
            Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions.
            New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city
            is Auckland.
          </p>
          <p>
            A developed country, it was the first to introduce a minimum wage,
            and the first to give women the right to vote. It ranks very highly
            in international measures of quality of life, human rights, and it
            has one of the lowest levels of perceived corruption in the world.
            It retains visible levels of inequality, having structural
            disparities between its MƒÅori and European populations. New Zealand
            underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed
            it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The
            service sector dominates the national economy, followed by the
            industrial sector, and agriculture; international tourism is also a
            significant source of revenue.
