            <h2>Why New Zealand?</h2>
            <h3>New Zealand, The Land of the Long WHite Cloud‚òÅÔ∏è</h3>
            <p>
              New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific
              Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses‚Äîthe North Island and the
              South Island ‚Äî and over 700 smaller islands. It is the
              sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia
              across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia,
              Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp
              mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic
              uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is
              Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.
            </p>
            <p>
              A developed country, it was the first to introduce a minimum wage,
              and the first to give women the right to vote. It ranks very
              highly in international measures of quality of life, human rights,
              and it has one of the lowest levels of perceived corruption in the
              world. It retains visible levels of inequality, having structural
              disparities between its MƒÅori and European populations. New
              Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which
              transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade
              economy. The service sector dominates the national economy,
              followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture; international
              tourism is also a significant source of revenue.
